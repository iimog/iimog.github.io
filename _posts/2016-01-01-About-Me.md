I'm a PhD student of life sciences at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.
As a fellow of the Graduate School of Life Sciences I started my PhD in July 2014.

## My Interests
-----

My research interests are the development and application of algorithms, tools and workflows to generate knowledge from biological data. I want to use the vast amount of publicly available data and software to unravel some of life's mysteries. I believe in open source, open data, open science and reproducible research. Currently my focus is on genomics and molecular biodiversity.
