I firmly believe that the only way to make good science is by making it as open and reproducible as possible.

I try to adopt certain policies to ensure the reproducibility of my own work. More on that in the project section. Moreover I try to make all data, scripts and protocols available after publication, this includes my electronic lab notebook. Science should be open throughout the whole process beginning with the idea. Unfortunately the open science approach is not yet as widely adopted. As a PhD student I collaborate in many larger projects and it is not on me to decide when the idea or results should be published. For now I focus on reproducibility and opening up my part of a project after publication. Furthermore I try to influence decisions in favor of openness.
