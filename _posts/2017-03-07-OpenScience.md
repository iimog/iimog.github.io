I firmly believe that the only way to make good science is by making it as open and reproducible as possible.

I try to adopt certain policies to ensure the reproducibility of my own work.
Moreover I try to make all data, scripts and protocols available.
Science should be open throughout the whole process beginning with the idea.
Unfortunately the open science approach is not yet as widely adopted.
I put a lot of effort in reproducibility and opening up my part of a project.
Furthermore I try to influence decisions in favor of openness.

In the [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/events/global-sprint-2016) I participated in the [OpenScience 101 Project](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101).
If you are interested in the project you might want to listen to [this episode](http://www.openscienceradio.de/2016/06/03/osr053-sprint-report-open-science-101-at-mozsprint-2016/) of [OpenScience Radio](http://www.openscienceradio.de/).
