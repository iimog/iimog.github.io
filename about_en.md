I'm group leader of [BioMedical Data Science](https://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/cctb/research/biomedical-data-science/) at the [Center for Computational and Theoretical Biology (CCTB)](https://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/cctb/cctb/) at the University of Würzburg.

My research interests are the development and application of algorithms, tools and workflows to generate knowledge from biomedical data.
Currently, my focus is on the possibilities and limitations of machine learning and artificial inteligence in biomedical research.
