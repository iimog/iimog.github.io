A web based transcriptome browser suitable for de novo transcriptomics.
It has been used to analyze the [Venus Flytrap transcriptome](http://tbro.carnivorom.com/).

TBro is a web application that allows biologists to browse the vast amount of data generated by RNA-seq experiments.
Powerful search options exist to find transcripts of interest.
All information for each transcript is aggregated on a single page.
Transcripts of interest can be organized in carts and analyzed together.

See the repository on [GitHub]({{page.github}}).
An article describing `TBro` is published in [Database](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baw146/2742073/TBro-visualization-and-management-of-de-novo).
A [poster](https://zenodo.org/record/61590#.WKWL1Ffn3mE) describing TBro was presented at the GCB 2016 in Berlin.
