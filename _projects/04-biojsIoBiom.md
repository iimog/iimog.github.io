A JavaScript library for handling data in Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) format.

This library provides an easy to use interface to interact with data in BIOM format.
The library itself is written using [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) and is tested with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).
In order to provide compatibility with both versions 1.0 and 2.1 of the BIOM format a [lightweight conversion server](https://github.com/molbiodiv/biom-conversion-server) has been developed.
You can find a public instance of the conversion server [here](https://biomcs.iimog.org/).

See the repository on [GitHub]({{page.github}}).
An article describing `biojs-io-biom` is published in [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2348/v2).
