An interactive visualization framework for whole genome alignments using d3.js
See an example visualization of [seven chloroplast genomes](https://alitvteam.github.io/AliTV/d3/AliTV.html).

The comparison of genome structures of organisms can yield interesting insights in evolutionary processes.
In order to do the comparison whole genome alignments are required.
However, the interpretation of whole genome alignments is difficult without proper visualization.
AliTV utilizes [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to create interactive visualizations of whole genome alignments.

See the repository on [GitHub]({{page.github}}).
A preprint describing `AliTV` is published in [PeerJ Preprints](https://peerj.com/preprints/2348v1/).
Further a [poster](https://zenodo.org/record/32014#.WKWPC1fn3mE) has been presented at Eureka 2015 in WÃ¼rzburg and a [talk](https://alitvteam.github.io/AliTV/gcb_2016/) (by Sonja Hohlfeld) at the GCB 2016 in Berlin.
